     * 2. Executing a game loop that continues through a maximum of 5 rounds or until the player accumulates three
     * wrong guesses.
     * 3. Each round involves:
     *    - Initializing the game state with a new word, hiding one letter.
     *    - Displaying the current word state and prompting for a guess.
     *    - Validating the player's input to ensure it is a single alphabetic character.
     *    - Checking the guess against the chosen word, updating the game state accordingly.
     * 4. Concludes the game by displaying the final result based on the game's outcome (win, loss, or draw).
     *
     * This method is central to the player interaction and game logic, ensuring that gameplay progresses smoothly
     * and rules are enforced.
