## Project: EconoCraft Pro

EconoCraft is a single player text adventure game where a player takes on the role of a business owner or manager,
tasked with growing their company from a small startup to a large corporation. The game would simulate real-world
business challenges, including resource management, market analysis, product development, and financial planning to
help students prepare for the future challenges.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* New Features: Added a typing game to simulate the player's work action.
  * What it does: allows users to type in the command to simulate the work action by playing a typing game.
  * Justification: This feature provides a more interactive way for users to simulate the work action, making the game more engaging.
  * Highlights: This feature required a good design of the command line ui to show clear prompts and feedback to the user.
* New Features: Added Company management system for advanced players.
* New Features: Added Random events at each player round.
