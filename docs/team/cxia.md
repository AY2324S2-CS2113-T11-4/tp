# Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
Our group have constructed an game to mimic user's daily life in working and investing.
EconoCraft is a single player text adventure game where a player takes on the role of a business owner or manager,
tasked with growing their company from a small startup to a large corporation. The game would simulate real-world
business challenges, including resource management, market analysis, product development, and financial planning to
help students prepare for the future challenges.
