## Project: EconoCraft Pro

EconoCraft is a single player text adventure game where a player takes on the role of a business owner or manager,
tasked with growing their company from a small startup to a large corporation. The game would simulate real-world
business challenges, including resource management, market analysis, product development, and financial planning to
help students prepare for the future challenges.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* New Features: Added a typing game to simulate the player's work action.
  * What is does: allows users to type in the command to simulate the work action.
